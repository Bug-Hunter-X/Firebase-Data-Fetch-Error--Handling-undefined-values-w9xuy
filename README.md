# Firebase Data Fetch Error: Handling undefined values
This repository demonstrates a common error when fetching data from Firebase and provides a solution.
The original code attempts to increment a counter in a Firestore document but doesn't handle the case where the 'count' field is missing.
The solution adds a check to ensure the 'count' field exists before incrementing it, preventing the error.
